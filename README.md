# DiabetesRisk_Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts diabetes risk using health and lifestyle data. Built with Python and scikit-learn, the model prioritises recall to identify individuals at risk as early as possible, supporting early intervention and prevention.

This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model to estimate an individual’s risk of developing diabetes using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. Diabetes is a major global health issue, and early identification is critical to improving long-term health outcomes. The aim of this project is to detect diabetes risk earlier than traditional diagnosis methods, enabling preventative action.

The project uses a combination of demographic, lifestyle, and clinical features to train a supervised classification model. I have used "recall" as the primary evaulation metric as this is a medical machine learning model. This reduces the risk of missing any false negative cases which could, in a real-world scenario, cause serious consequences.
